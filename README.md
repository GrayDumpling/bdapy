This project aims to reproduce analyses done in the book
Bayesian Data Analysis (Gelman et al, 3rd Edition) in Python
without relying on black-box Bayesian inference libraries,
so that I can familiarize myself with conducting Bayesian inference in Python.
Hopefully this is a useful resource for other people as well.

Here is the list of notebooks I wrote:

* [Chapter 5.3. Hierarchical Bayesian Inference of Binomial Probabilities](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/bikestra/bdapy/blob/master/ch5_3_rat_tumor.ipynb)
* [Chapter 5.4 ~ 6. Hierarchical Bayesian Inference of Group Normal Means](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/bikestra/bdapy/blob/master/ch5_4-5-6_hierarchical_normal.ipynb)
