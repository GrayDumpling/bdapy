This project aims to reproduce analyses done in the book
Bayesian Data Analysis (Gelman et al, 3rd Edition) in Python
without relying on black-box Bayesian inference libraries,
so that I can familiarize myself with conducting Bayesian inference in Python.
Hopefully this is a useful resource for other people as well.
