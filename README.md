This project aims to reproduce analyses done in the book
Bayesian Data Analysis (Gelman et al, 3rd Edition) in Python
without relying on black-box Bayesian inference libraries,
so that I can familiarize myself with conducting Bayesian inference in Python.
Hopefully this is a useful resource for other people as well.

Here is the list of notebooks I wrote:

* [Chapter 5.3. Hierarchical Bayesian Inference of Binomial Probabilities (on rat tumor data)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/bikestra/bdapy/blob/master/ch5_3_rat_tumor.ipynb)
* [Chapter 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 6.5. Hierarchical Bayesian Inference of Group Normal Means (on SAT coaching data and beta-blocker data)](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/bikestra/bdapy/blob/master/ch5-4_5-5_5-6_6_5_hierarchical_normal.ipynb)
